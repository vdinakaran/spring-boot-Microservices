Monolithic architecture
------------------------

Monolithic Architecture is like a big container, wherein all the software components of an app are assembled and tightly coupled, i.e., each component fully depends on each other.

Disadvantages
---------------------
Disadvantage:

Large and Complex Applications:
it is difficult for maintenance because they are dependent on each other.
Slow Development:
It is because, for modify an application we have to redeploy whole application instead of updates part.
Unscalable:
Each copy of the application will access the hole data which make more memory consumption. We cannot scale each component independently.
Unreliable:
If one services goes down, then it affects all the services provided by the application.
Inflexible:
Really difficult to adopt new technology.It is because we have to change whole application technology.



Microservices
----------------------
It is an architectural development style in which the application is made up of smaller services that handle a small portion of the functionality and data by communicating with each other directly using lightweight protocols like HTTP. 
The Microservice architecture has a significant impact on the relationship between the application and the database. Instead of sharing a single database with other microservices, each microservice has its own database.
